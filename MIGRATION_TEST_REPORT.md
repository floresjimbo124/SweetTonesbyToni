# 🧪 Migration Test Report

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED** (1 issue found and fixed)

## Overview

After migrating from JSON files to database storage, all features have been tested and verified to work correctly.

---

## ✅ Features Tested

### 1. Available Dates Management ✅
**Status:** WORKING  
**Database:** `available_dates` table

#### Admin Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/available-dates` - Fetch all available dates
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/available-dates` - Create new available date
- ✅ `PUT /api/admin/available-dates/:id` - Update existing date
- ✅ `DELETE /api/admin/available-dates/:id` - Delete a date

#### Public Endpoint
- ✅ `GET /api/available-dates` - Fetch available dates (filters past dates)

#### Verification
- ✅ All endpoints properly use `async/await`
- ✅ Data retrieved from database (not JSON)
- ✅ Duplicate date checking works
- ✅ Slot calculations work correctly
- ✅ Future date filtering works

---

### 2. Product Limits Management ✅
**Status:** WORKING  
**Database:** `product_limits` table

#### Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/product-limits` - Public endpoint for limits
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/product-limits` - Admin endpoint
- ✅ `PUT /api/admin/product-limits` - Update limits

#### Verification
- ✅ All endpoints properly use `async/await`
- ✅ Data retrieved from database (not JSON)
- ✅ Limits properly enforced on orders
- ✅ Audit trail with `updated_by` field
- ✅ Setting limit to 0 removes it

---

### 3. Order Submission ✅
**Status:** WORKING (FIXED)  
**Database:** `orders` table

#### Process Flow
1. ✅ Validate customer info
2. ✅ Validate cart items
3. ✅ Check stock availability
4. ✅ Decrement product stock (database)
5. ✅ **Decrement available date slots (database)** ← FIXED
6. ✅ Save order to database
7. ✅ Send email confirmation

#### Issue Found & Fixed
**Problem:**  
- `delivery_type` was not being extracted from request body
- `delivery_type` column was missing from orders table
- Slot decrement function was called with undefined variable

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Added `delivery_type` column to orders table
- ✅ Extract `delivery_type` from `req.body`
- ✅ Default to `'pickup'` if not specified
- ✅ Store `delivery_type` in database for each order
- ✅ Pass `delivery_type` to slot decrement function

#### Code Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const { name, email, phone, delivery_date, ... } = req.body;
await decrementAvailableDateSlot(delivery_type, delivery_date); // delivery_type undefined!

// AFTER (FIXED)
const { name, email, phone, delivery_date, delivery_type, ... } = req.body;
const dateType = delivery_type || 'pickup'; // Default value
await decrementAvailableDateSlot(dateType, delivery_date); // Works!
```

### 4. Backup System ✅
**Status:** WORKING  
**Includes:** Database + Uploads folder

#### Components
- ✅ Database backup (`orders.db`)
- ✅ Uploads backup (payment proofs + product images)
- ✅ Daily schedule at 2:00 AM
- ✅ Initial backup on startup
- ✅ 30-day retention
- ✅ Automatic cleanup

#### Verification
- ✅ Backups directory created
- ✅ JSON files manually backed up
- ✅ Uploads folder manually backed up
- ✅ Backup functions work correctly

---

### 5. Automatic Migrations ✅
**Status:** WORKING  
**Runs On:** Server startup

#### Migration Flow
1. ✅ Check if tables exist (create if missing)
2. ✅ Check for existing data in database
3. ✅ If no data exists, check for JSON files
4. ✅ Migrate data from JSON to database
5. ✅ Backup original JSON files
6. ✅ Log migration status

#### Tables Migrated
- ✅ `available_dates` (from available-dates.json)
- ✅ `product_limits` (from product-limits.json)
- ✅ `products` (from products.json)

#### Migration Safety
- ✅ Only runs if database is empty
- ✅ Original JSON files backed up
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Non-destructive (keeps JSON files)

---

## 🔍 Code Quality Checks

### Async/Await Consistency ✅
- ✅ All database functions use `async/await`
- ✅ All endpoints that call async functions are async
- ✅ All async functions properly awaited
- ✅ No missing `await` keywords

### Error Handling ✅
- ✅ Try/catch blocks in all async functions
- ✅ Errors logged to console
- ✅ Graceful degradation where appropriate
- ✅ User-friendly error messages

### Database Operations ✅
- ✅ Proper prepared statements
- ✅ SQL injection protection
- ✅ Transaction safety
- ✅ Foreign key constraints

### Backward Compatibility ✅
- ✅ Defaults provided for missing fields
- ✅ Old orders still viewable
- ✅ Graceful handling of legacy data
- ✅ Migration is automatic and safe

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Missing delivery_type Handling
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Slot decrement would fail silently  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Details:**
- Order submission was calling `decrementAvailableDateSlot(delivery_type, delivery_date)`
- But `delivery_type` was never extracted from `req.body`
- Variable was `undefined`, causing function to fail
- Slots weren't being decremented properly

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// 1. Added delivery_type column to orders table
delivery_type TEXT DEFAULT 'pickup'

// 2. Extract from request body
const { ..., delivery_type, ... } = req.body;

// 3. Use with default value
const dateType = delivery_type || 'pickup';
await decrementAvailableDateSlot(dateType, delivery_date);

// 4. Store in database
INSERT INTO orders (..., delivery_type, ...) VALUES (..., ?, ...)
```
